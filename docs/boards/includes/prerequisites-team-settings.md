## Prerequisites

* You must have a Kanban board you want to configure. When you add a team, you add a Kanban board for that team. To learn more, see [About teams and Agile tools](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/about-teams-and-settings).
* You must be added to the team administrator role for the team's settings you want to modify, or be a member of the **Project Administrators** security group. To get added, see [Add a team administrator](/azure/devops/organizations/settings/add-team-administrator) or [Set permissions at the project- or collection-level](/azure/devops/organizations/security/set-project-collection-level-permissions).
* To drag-and-drop cards on the board or reorder cards to the board, you must be granted **Basic** access or higher. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels#access-level-settings).
* If you have **Stakeholder** access, you can edit work items on the board and add existing tags to a work item. You can't add work items to a board, can't drag-and-drop work items to update status or reorder cards, and can't update fields displayed on cards. For details, see [About access levels](/azure/devops/organizations/security/access-levels#access-level-settings).
