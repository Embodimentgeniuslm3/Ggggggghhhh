## Public projects	

A project created within an Azure DevOps Services organization that is visible to the whole world. Everyone in the world can discover them and perform limited operations. You can use the [Azure DevOps CLI to discover a list of projects](/azure/devops/organizations/projects/create-project#list-and-connect-to-projects). Administrators can control who gets to fully contribute. Administrators can switch a project from private to public, and vice-versa, as described in [Change the project visibility](/azure/devops/organizations/public/make-project-public).
