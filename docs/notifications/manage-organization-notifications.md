# Manage Global notifications

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-tfs-2017-on](../includes/version-tfs-2017-through-vsts.md)]

Global notifications manage notifications for all projects defined for an organization or collection. 

[!INCLUDE [note-earlier-tfs-version](includes/note-earlier-tfs-version.md)]

::: moniker range="azure-devops"
> [!TIP]
> We don't support organization-wide notifications. As an alternative, you can provide an email distribution list that goes to your entire organization. Also, you can generate a banner with the [**az devops banner command**](../organizations/settings/manage-banners.md) that all users see when they sign in.

## Global notifications

Open the Global notifications page as described in [Navigating the UI, Open Global notifications ](navigating-the-ui.md#open-org-level).

You can select from one of the following four tabs to perform various administrative tasks: 

* **Default subscriptions**: View all [default notification subscriptions](./oob-built-in-notifications.md)
* **Subscribers**: View notification subscriptions for a specific group, team, or individual
* **Statistics**: View the most active subscriptions and top event initiators
* **Settings**: Manage global level settings such as delivery preferences.


[!INCLUDE [note-smtp-server](includes/note-smtp-server.md)]

## Default subscriptions

The **Default subscriptions** tab lists all default global subscriptions available. The globe icon on a notification subscription indicates the subscription is a default subscription.

Members of the **Project Collection Administrators** group have permission to enable/disable any default subscription in this view. Any member of the **Project Collection Valid Users** group has permission to view the details of the default subscription. The view and enable options are available in the context menu (`...`) associated with each individual subscription.

## Subscribers

The **Subscribers** section begins with an empty identity search box. Enter any group, team, or individual to view the list of subscriptions associated with the specified identity.

>![Organization level notifications page: Subscribers empty](media/view-organization-notification-subscribers-empty.png)

All notification subscriptions for the chosen identity are listed in this view. Management options are available from the context menu (`...`) associated with each subscription. Note, the ![globe](media/oob-notification.png) icon on subscription row indicates a default subscription.

For selected security groups or teams, you can change the delivery settings by choosing **Delivery settings**.

## Statistics

The **Statistics** section shows the most active notification subscriptions and the top event initiators (group, team, or individual). The statistics are only for the current day and reset at 00:00 UTC. A benefit of these statistics is identifying unintended high volume subscriptions or event initiators.

## Settings

The **Settings** section allows organization level notification settings to be managed by any member of the **project collection administrators** group. All teams and groups inherit the _Default delivery option_ setting, which is why it isn't explicitly set at the team or group level.
