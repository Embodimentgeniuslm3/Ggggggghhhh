# Set up billing

[!INCLUDE [version-vsts-only](../../includes/version-vsts-only.md)]

In this article, learn how to set up billing for your organization in Azure DevOps. Do so before making purchases, so you have it in place once you're ready to buy.

*All services are billed via Azure*. You're not required to use any other Azure services.
