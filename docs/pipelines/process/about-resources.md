# About pipeline resources

A [resource](resources.md) is anything used by a pipeline that lives outside the pipeline. Resources are:
* a way to share something such as a secure file or password across pipelines
* a tool for enhancing security through access checks and other restrictions
* a way to improve traceability for your pipeline and make it easier to troubleshoot [environments](environments.md)

Resources are a way to share information across pipelines. Good examples of using resources for sharing are variable groups, secure files, and service connections. In all these cases, you're using a resource as a way for a pipeline to access and consume something. 

Resources are also useful for restricting access and making sure your valuable information is shared with the fewest number of authorized users or pipelines. For example, you can limit a service connection to only run on one pipeline. You could also make sure that a repository can only be accessed from a pipeline after a manual approach check. 

You can also use resources for better traceability. When you use resources with environments, you can trace the lifecycle of your resources. For example, you'll be able to see the number of the last run that was deployed to an [environment](environments.md).
## Share resources across pipelines

You can share resources across pipelines by configuring resources within the pipelines UI and then referencing those resources in a task. You can also access some shared resources with the [`resources` YAML pipeline syntax](resources.md). 

Examples of sharing resources with the pipelines UI include [secure files](../library/secure-files.md), [variable groups](../library/variable-groups.md), and [service connections](../../extend/develop/service-endpoints.md). With the `resources` syntax, examples include accessing pipelines themselves, repositories, and packages.  

The way you use a resource in a pipeline depends on the type of pipeline and the type of resource.


#### [YAML](#tab/yaml)

For YAML pipelines:
* Service connections and secure files are directly used as inputs to tasks. They do not have to be pre-declared. 
* Variable groups use the `group` syntax. 
* Pipelines and repositories use the `resources` syntax. 

For example, to use variable groups in a pipeline, you'll first add your variables at **Pipelines** > **Library**. Then, you can reference the variable group in your YAML pipeline with the `variables` syntax. 

```yml
variables:
- group: my-variable-group
``` 

To call a second pipeline from your pipeline with the `resources` syntax, reference `pipelines`. 

```yml
resources:
  pipelines:
  - pipeline: SmartHotel-resource # identifier for the resource (used in pipeline resource variables)
    source: SmartHotel-CI # name of the pipeline that produces an artifact
```

#### [Classic](#tab/classic)

You can reference service connections, variable groups, and secure files with the classic editor. For example, the `Deploy Azure App Service` task here uses the `MyAzureApp` service connection as an input.

Similarly, to share a variable between pipelines with the classic editor, you can [link a variable group](../library/variable-groups.md).

## Use resources to enhance security

You can enhance your pipeline's security with resources by identifying how that resource gets consumed, and how to prevent an unauthorized access. 

For YAML pipelines only, one way to restrict resources is by setting them as [protected or open](../security/resources.md). When a resource is protected, you can apply approvals and checks to it and limit access to specific users and pipelines. Protected resources include service connections, agent pools, environments, repositories, variable groups, and secure files.

## Use resources for traceability
#### [YAML](#tab/yaml)

For YAML pipelines, you can combine resources with environments to better track resource use. [Environments](environments.md) are collections of resources using in pipelines. 

Environments support two resource types:
- [Kubernetes](environments-kubernetes.md)
- [Virtual machines](environments-virtual-machines.md)

#### [Classic](#tab/classic)
For Classic release pipelines, [deployment groups](../release/deployment-groups/index.md) offer traceability tools.
